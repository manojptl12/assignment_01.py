51)How Do You Traverse Through a Dictionary Object in Python? 

In Python, you can traverse through a dictionary object using various methods depending on what part of the dictionary you want to access (keys, values, or key-value pairs). Here are the common methods:

1. Traversing Through Keys

You can iterate over the keys in a dictionary using a for loop:

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in my_dict:
    print(key)
Alternatively, you can explicitly use the keys() method:
for key in my_dict.keys():
    print(key)


2. Traversing Through Values

To iterate over the values, use the values() method:
for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)

3. Traversing Through Key-Value Pairs

To traverse both the keys and values, use the items() method:
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {value}")

4. Traversing in a Sorted Manner

If you want to traverse the dictionary in a sorted order (by keys):
for key in sorted(my_dict):
print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {my_dict[key]}")

5. Traversing Using Comprehensions

You can also use dictionary comprehensions to iterate over a dictionary:
squared_values = {key: value ** 2 for key, value in my_dict.items()}
print(squared_values)

These are the common ways to traverse through a dictionary in Python.



52) How Do You Check the Presence of a Key in A Dictionary? 

In Python, you can check the presence of a key in a dictionary using several methods. Here are the common ones:

1. Using the in Operator
The most common and Pythonic way to check if a key exists in a dictionary is by using the in operator:

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

if 'a' in my_dict:
    print("Key 'a' is present.")
else:
    print("Key 'a' is not present.")

2. Using the get() Method

You can use the get() method to check for a key and provide a default value if the key is not found:
value = my_dict.get('a', None)
if value is not None:
    print("Key 'a' is present.")
else:
    print("Key 'a' is not present.")
The get() method returns None (or a default value you provide) if the key doesn't exist.

3. Using the keys() Method

You can also explicitly check the key in the list of dictionary keys, although this is less efficient and not recommended for large dictionaries:
if 'a' in my_dict.keys():
    print("Key 'a' is present.")

However, using the in operator is generally the preferred way due to its clarity and efficiency.
